# VR Plugin for Unity

## Introduction

Newcomers to the **Decoroso Crespo Laboratory**, who join new groups to develop VR software using **Unity** as a development platform, find it difficult to integrate some of the devices the laboratory has, such as **Oculus**, **Leap Motion**, **Gamepad**, **Stereowall** and **3D Mouse**. 

They must learn to master Unity on their own and then integrate the devices they need to use in the project. This process can take time for a newcomer, and time spent in digesting this knowledge and then implementing the development project can affect the duration of the project itself. This project is a contribution for these groups to save time when starting a project in **Unity**, through a plugin that can transparently configure the devices that they want to use in the project, minimizing the effort and time spent in configuring and integrating these devices independently.
